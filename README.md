# react
Module 1: Deploy and Host a React App
Introduction
AWS Amplify provides a Git-based CI/CD workflow for building, deploying, and hosting single page web applications or static sites with serverless backends. Upon connecting to a Git repository, Amplify determines the build settings for both the front-end framework and any serverless backend resources configured with the Amplify CLI, and automatically deploys updates with every code commit.

In this module, we’ll begin by creating a new React application and push it to a GitHub repository. Then, we will connect the repository to AWS Amplify web hosting and deploy it to a globally available content delivery network (CDN) hosted on an amplifyapp.com domain. Next, we’ll demonstrate continuous deployment capabilities by making changes to the React application and push a new version to the master branch which will automatically kick off a new deployment.
